Developed a full-stack web application to clone the OpenAI's GPT language model. Created a backend with Node.js and Express to act as a server and access the OpenAI API. Integrated the API to generate natural language responses to user input and fine-tune the model. Developed a user-friendly front-end using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in developing a proper environment for app development, integrating APIs and my first glimpse of full-stack development, which will help me to understand the complete software development process.
